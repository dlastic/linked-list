# Linked List

This project implements a singly linked list in JavaScript, providing fundamental operations such as appending, prepending, inserting at specific positions, removing nodes, and searching for values. It maintains accurate `head` and `tail` references and includes utility methods like `size`, `at`, `toString`, and `contains` for interacting with the list.
